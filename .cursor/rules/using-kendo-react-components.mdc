# Your rule content
When creating a new component, let's prioritize using Kendo Components (ref: https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/)
- Let's not use primitive Kendo components directly on our application but rather have them imported within `src/components/kendo` and then used from these files
- Let's keep track of each Kendo component used under `src/components/kendo/premium` and `src/components/kendo/free`
