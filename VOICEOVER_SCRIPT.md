Welcome to SmartDocs, where AI-powered document editing meets intuitive design. Let me show you how SmartDocs helps you create and edit documents while just vibing with your work.

[0:10-0:20]
First, let's create a new document. Notice how clean and straightforward the interface is. With just one click on the "New Document" button, we're ready to start.

[0:20-0:35]
Let's say we need to write an internship application letter for Microsoft. Instead of starting from scratch, we'll ask our AI assistant. Watch how naturally this works.
*[Show typing: "Create a draft application letter for a software engineering internship at Microsoft"]*

[0:35-0:55]
Within seconds, SmartDocs generates a professional draft. The AI understands the context and format needed for an application letter, including relevant technical skills and Microsoft-specific details.

[0:55-1:15]
Now, let's refine this draft. The middle section feels a bit lengthy. We'll ask the AI to make it more concise and professional.
*[Show typing: "Make the second paragraph shorter and more professional, focusing on technical skills"]*

[1:15-1:30]
See how smoothly the AI adjusts the content? It maintains the professional tone while making the message more impactful. No context switching, just natural collaboration.

[1:30-1:45]
Now, let's explore another powerful feature. We can import existing documents and transform them with AI assistance. Here's a contractor agreement for a software developer.

Let's say we need to adapt this contract for a UX Developer position instead. Watch how SmartDocs handles this.
*[Show typing: "Modify this contract to be for a UX Developer position, updating relevant skills and responsibilities"]*

[2:05-2:25]
The AI intelligently identifies and updates all relevant sections - job title, skills, responsibilities, and deliverables - while maintaining the legal integrity of the document. Notice the changes are highlighted for easy review.

[2:25-2:40]
With a quick save, our new contract is ready. SmartDocs maintains version history, so you can always track changes or revert if needed.

[2:40-2:55]
This is Vibe Writing at its best - where you and AI work together seamlessly, making document creation and editing feel effortless and natural.
